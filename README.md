## Intro
The TEAM_3 made this APP as part of the Goit course training.
The app can be used by anyone and everyone. This is a web application that categorizes images. All you need to do is upload the picture you need, and the application will show which of the 10 classes it belongs to. The trained convolutional neural network DenseNet was taken as a basis and was improved by our team. This neural network can assign images to 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). This is a very powerful neural network. And we made it for you, and absolutely free. Enjoy!
